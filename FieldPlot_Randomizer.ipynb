    "## Description\n",
    "Treatment randomization is a crucial component of experimental design. Improper randomization can introduce systematic biases in response observations or measurements. Often time we want to attribute causality to treatment effects. Systematic biases may be hard to detect in measurement data, but render this attribution invalid. As such, the randomization process is quite important, and yet often under-appreciated. Automating the randomization process could reduce likelihood of such problems. A program was written in python to provide researchers an easy to use randomization tool. This function was inspired by a recent challenge in the AGRON 935 Scientific Program course taught by Dr. Andres Patrignani at the Agronomy Department at Kansas State University. \n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, we were challenged to use for loops to randomize nitrogen (N) application treatments with a given number of replications on field research plots. The randomization procedure varies with design of experiment (DoE), but uses similar information for each design (i.e. # of treatments, replications, etc.). This results in creation of several loops, where the correct loop is dependent on the DoE being used. Since these loops use similar inputs, they could be joined together via logic statements and incorporated into a single function. This function was developed with field research in mind, but can, of course, easily be extended to laboratory work as well."
